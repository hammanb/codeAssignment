Problem 1: 
Setup 
  A robot that has been dropped into a square 9x9 grid of square rooms. Walls between rooms have doors in them, but walls on the edge do not. All of the doors are closed initially. 
  The robot can: 
  1. Check each direction (N,S,E,W) for door status, which returns open, closed or none. 
  2. Move one room over at a time through an open door. 
  3. Remember details of rooms itâ€™s visited since it was dropped in.
  
Questions 
You can write your answers with words, flowcharts or pseudocode. 
  1. The robot starts at the lower right corner of the grid. How can the robot use its abilities to count the total number of rooms in the grid? 
    
    See the pseudo code below. Robot counts all rooms in a row and column, and multiplies them.
      
  2. The game resets and the robot moves to a random room in the grid. Does your approach still work? 
    
    Yes, assuming the grid is always a square or rectangle, adding up all rooms in row and column, and multiplying them would work.
      
  3. How many moves does it take to complete the count? Can you find the answer in less moves? 
      
    The approach I took starts in a direction from starting room, and then goes in the other direction from starting room. This would mean the total amount of moves for this approach would be (row length - 1) * (column length - 1). 
      
Extra Credit 
  4. How much data did you save from each move? Can you save less data? 
    
    Assuming the starting grid is only a square or rectangle, the minimum necessary data saved to the data structure in my pseudocode below would only be a record of it's presence. If minimum storage was the goal, you could also just increase a count as you move rooms, to store a single "count" variable. 
    However, each loop of the recursive method would need to gather the door information into memory, and the recursive stack memory will increase with each loop. This approach would be fine with data storage, but memory will hit a limit eventually. If call stack memory is limited, you would need to store each movement in the database with all the rooms parameters, and do async movements to populate the rows and columns.  
    
  5. 2 arbitrarily selected rooms in the grid are removed (count as zero, no doors lead to these areas). Will this change your approach? How does this affect the number of moves required? 

    Yes, the approach would be different if there were an infinite number of room orientations. 
    One approach would be to start branching your path with the recursive function at each room, and start a recursive branch of the function for each. 
    A check would need to be in place at the beginning of each loop for the room's unid if it is already in the database to prevent an infinite recursive loop. 
    Again, if call stack size is a concern, then you would need to do async operations, and store more data to the data structure for each of your movements.
  
  6. What tests would you write for your robot? 

    Depends on what you are testing: 
    If you want to test units of the code, you could break down specific operations from the script.
    If you want to test the output result, choose a different starting room from the same grid and run the operation to verify the result.
    If you want to test scalability, run the script against a chosen grid size of the maximum expected grid.

/* ====Pseudo code===== */
get <starting room>

create <grid row>
    <move room> in the East direction in <grid row>, starting at <starting room>
    <move room> in the West direction in <grid row>, starting at <starting room>
    return count of rooms
create <grid column> 
    <move room> in the North direction in <grid column>, starting at <starting room>
    <move room> in the West direction in <grid column>, starting at <starting room>
    return count of rooms
    
<move room> in <direction> using <data structure>, starting at <room>
    create a new <current room>
        add <current room> to <data structure>
    Get <current room> direction parameters
    if can continue to move <direction>, open the door, then <move room> in <direction> using <data structure>, starting at <next room>
    if can't move <direction>, break

output: count of <grid row> * count of <grid column>
