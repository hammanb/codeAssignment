I haven't used mongodb or mongoose before, so took a bit of time to read through the documentation here to be able to accomplish the questions in the problem.

I only had a couple hours to spend on this yesterday and today during meetings, and spent most of that time reading docs. Unfortunately I didn't get to the bonus questions here. Going through the docs I understand that mongoose would be the solution to those extra questions. https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html
