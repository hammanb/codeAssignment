I haven't used mongodb or mongoose before, so took a bit of time to read through the documentation here to be able to accomplish the questions in the problem.

Looking at the questions, the output of the problem is a single executing script with sequential answers to the questions. As I knew the details of the database, and decided to interperet the instructions as written, my instinct here is to run as few database queries and transformations as possible for performance reasons. If the problem was asked differently, I would have approached the script slightly different such as if there were scalibility concerns (more, but more targeted queries) or reusability concerns (questions asked out of order, single question asked). However, for brevity of my code, and optimized performance, I decided to approach this problem in this way.

I only had a couple hours to spend on this yesterday and today during meetings, and spent most of that time reading docs. Unfortunately I didn't get to the bonus questions here. Going through the docs I understand that mongoose, and mongodb validations would be the solution to those extra questions https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html
