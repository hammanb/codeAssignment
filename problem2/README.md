I haven't used mongodb or mongoose before, so took a bit of time to read through the documentation here to be able to accomplish the questions in the problem.

Looking at the questions, the output of the problem is a single executing script with sequential answers to the questions. As I knew the details of the database im querying, and was given just the single problem, my instinct here is to run as few database queries and transformations as possible. If the problem was asked differently, or if there were scalibility (more, but more targeted queries) or reusability concerns (questions asked out of order, single question asked), I would have approached the script slightly different. However, for brevity of my code to approach this problem I coded it in this way.

I only had a couple hours to spend on this yesterday and today during meetings, and spent most of that time reading docs. Unfortunately I didn't get to the bonus questions here. Going through the docs I understand that mongoose, and mongodb validations would be the solution to those extra questions https://mongoosejs.com/docs/validation.html
